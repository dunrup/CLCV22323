## Permanence and sustainability
Simultaneously an A and a C

The Perseus Digital Library is hosted by Tufts University, with strong connections to the University of Leipzig, and therefore likely 'sustainable' in the sense that its development and upkeep will stick around as long as the universities do. However, now might be a strange time to grade Perseus' 'sustainability,' because the entire library is undergoing massive renovations and a migration to Scaife (and soon, to "Beyond Translations"). Therefore, the main site has an "About" page that hasn't been updated in 20 years and a "Current research" page last updated in 2008/9. Similarly, their last reported grant is from '09. However, this is misleading, because the site also links to an up-to-the-minute "Perseus Updates" blog, which is being actively maintained.

## Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
A

Massive digitized corpus linked to their hopper/morph tool. Very intuitive to use. Easy to navigate. Can open multiple texts on the same page. No maps/visualizations, but I don't know if that's a fair expectation.

## Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
5 stars, as far as I can tell.

★ 	    Available on the web (whatever format) but with an open licence, to be Open Data
★★ 	    Available as machine-readable structured data (e.g. excel instead of image scan of a table)
★★★ 	as (2) plus non-proprietary format (e.g. CSV instead of excel)
★★★★ 	All the above plus, Use open standards from W3C (RDF and SPARQL) to identify things, so that people can point at your stuff
