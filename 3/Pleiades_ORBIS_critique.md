# Pleiades

## Permanence and sustainability
A

Sponsored by NYU's ISAW, so probably will stay online as long as ISAW is healthy. Can live past that time as well, as all data is available to download.
      
## Openness or restriction of their data
A+

Per their site: "All published information resources in Pleiades are free and open to the public. No login is required." All data is available to download.
    
## Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
A+

Highly intuitive tools with detailed tutorials for use. 

## Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)

Uncertain how to grade along this axis.

## Permanence and sustainability
A

As far as I can tell, this site and its data will stay online as long as Stanford University continues to host it, although I don't see a way to download its data and run it offline.

## Openness or restriction of their data
A

Extensive write-up in the "Building" section of their "About" page that lays out the details and assumptions built into the model and the evidence/data that underpin these arguments. Ample bibliography.
I can easily export via the "Export SVG" function to edit the maps that I use the tool to make.
     

## Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
A+

Highly intuitive tools with detailed tutorials for use. Fully visualized dataset that can be manipulated by the user to do further resources.

## Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
