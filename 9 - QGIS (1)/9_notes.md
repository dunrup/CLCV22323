Goal: use GIS to analyze 3rd cent. BCE Athenian countryside, juxtaposing cult locations (and change thereto) with occupying military bases.

Background: 3rd cent BCE Athens was in crisis: Macedonian and Ptolemaic occupation.

Thesis: many affected cult locations identified and mapped with GIS. Proof of "alterations in cult practice": cessation, rerouting rituals, establishment of substites, etc.

Why GIS?: these "solutions" don't show up in written sources, but appear in the material record.

Results: can't really tell what the effect of Macedonian/Ptolemaic garrisons was in Sounion/Patrokloks Island, respectively. Changes happened, but "the sacralised movement axes remain unclear." Laureotike, however, definitely changed after the end of the 4th c "silver rush."
