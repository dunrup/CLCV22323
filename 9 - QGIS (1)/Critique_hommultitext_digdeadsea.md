# The Homer Multitext project

## Permanence and sustainability
C

As far as I can tell (from the site's "About" page), the Homer Multitext Project is run and maintained (?) by two editors and two "Project Architects," all of whom have university affiliations, but it does not seem that the HMT itself has a any sort of affiliate status.

Free site; images are under Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 license. Can dowload texts in multiple formats and all digitized images.

## Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
A

Searchable, easy to browse the images in multiple ways. Interface is clunky, but that is not a serious criticism.

## Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
At least 3 stars -- all currently published data is available on github; the hmt-archive as a plain-text file, etc.


# The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls

## Permanence and sustainability
B-

Developed by the Israel Museum with Google, two institutes that I am certain will last long, but funded by the "Center for Online Judaic Studies," George S. Blumenthal's educational/philanthropic 'organization' (really just a WordPress website and grant money, as far as I can tell). 

The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls website looks like it hasn't been updated in years, which makes sense given that Blumenthal shifted his interests in the mid 2010's away from digitization. (And apparently tried to have all traces of his name scrubbed from the internet -- even his Wikipedia page can only be accessed with an archive like the wayback machine). 

The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls website will probably stay online as long as the (partially publicly funded) Isreal Museum stays open, but I doubt it will be maintained or updated. For instance, the decades-old closed chat on the right-hand side of every page; the logo at the top-right of the page takes you to a dead site, etc.

The Great Isaiah Scroll is digitally parsed so that you can click through to bring up translations. None of the others do similarly. 

There are no transcriptions of the text, no dictionaries to pop up, can't compare on the site between different papyri, etc.

The pictures are quite crisp though.
