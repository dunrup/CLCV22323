Geographic information system

A GIS (Graphical Information System) is a tool that can create, analyze, and visualize maps of various data types. Per Foote & Lynch (1995),

> With GIS it is possible to map, model, query, and analyze large quantities of data all held together within a single database. 

In order to do this, a GIS needs a common spatial coordinate system for all its inputs (often latitude, longitude, and elevation) which is used much like the index in a set/list/array as a reference point for any other data associated with a particular value.
