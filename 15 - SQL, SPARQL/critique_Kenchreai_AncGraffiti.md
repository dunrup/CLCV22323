# Kenchreai Arch Project
    
## Permanence and sustainability
A

A project of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, so probably fine funding and maintenance. 

## Openness or restriction of their data
B+

Free to use, but ©2017-2023 The American Excavations at Kenchreai. Data and images available for non-commercial, personal use only. All data can be downloaded on github.

## Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
B

No browse or cateogory-browse function -- just a database to search thru. Good for SPARQL queries.

## Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)

4 stars (don't see links to other people's data)


# Ancient Graffiti

## Permanence and sustainability
B

Funding is probably fine (Harvard CHS, Mellon, USA NEH), altho the last grant I can find is from 2017. Works with EDR (www.edr-edr.it) and EAGLE (https://www.eagle-network.eu/) Website last updated Aug 2023, so someone's still getting paid (probably) to work there.
      
## Openness or restriction of their data
A+

## Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
B

As far as I can tell, all EDR links are broken? Also, no images of any graffiti on the site seems like a strange choice. 

## Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
A+! 5 stars!
