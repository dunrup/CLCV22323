# Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (TLL)

## Permanence and sustainability
A+

I mean this thing got started in the 1800's and it's still kicking. It's not going anywhere.
Serious answer: actively under construction and updated all the time. Tied to BADW, but a communal work of 31+ universities. 

## Openness or restriction of their data
B

There is an open access version available online, but the TLL itself I'm pretty sure is accessible thru library subscriptions. You can download previously published parts as PDF free from their website.


## Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
B-

It's just digitized pdfs (which makes sense, considering this project far predates any digital tools).

Just some guy's website. Russell Fleming (per his tutoring page) is not, as far as I can tell, sponsored by anyone in particular. He just updates when he wants to, and some day will stop maintaining this site (by choice or by fate).

It's a blog. The 'data', insofar as it is, for example, this guy's write-up od what happens in each book of the *Aeneid* is free and available for us to print, but there is no 'data' behind the maps that he's put out. As far as I can tell, he's just gone on Google My Maps and uploaded info from previously printed material.

## Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
C
Once again, it's a blog. The 'functionality' is just embedding google's map program into the page.
