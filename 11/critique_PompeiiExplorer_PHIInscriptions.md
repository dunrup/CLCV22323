# Pompeii: 3D-explorer

## Permanence and sustainability
B+/A-
Per Wikipedia, CyArk is a non-profit funded by a host of donors (e.g., Microsoft, IBM) and partnered with several national organizations (e.g., US National Park Service, Mexico's Dept. of History & Anthropology). Funding is probably secure in the near future, but I see no long-term plan to join with an org like a university.

## Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
B+/A-

The site is intuitive and functional. Some parts of the site are non-functional, e.g., the "Pompeii Resources" page cannot only be accessed thru the Ancient Civilizations collection page, not thru the Pompeii page itself

## Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
2 - 3 stars -- can access the data through the OpenHeritage3d site. Umcertain if in propriertary format.
No links to other sites.


# Searchable Greek Inscriptions (PHI)

## Permanence and sustainability
B

Another non-profit, with no direct university affiliation. PHI will probably be around for as long as a Packhard scion cares about humanities. Per David W. Packhard's statement on the site right now, the PHI Greek Inscription database is undergoing changes and currently lacks much of the team that was originally responsible for creating it.

> For the past year PHI has been actively planning the next stage of our various scholarly database projects, including Latin and Greek inscriptions. We are giving serious thought to creating a center at our Stoa in Santa Clarita, perhaps affiliated with UCLA, which would host a series of related projects that offer broad and free public access to collections of historical texts and other materials (including music and even historic newsreels).

Free to access, fair use copywright. No way to download, as far as I can tell.

## Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
B

Honestly quite difficult to navigate around the site, and browsing comes with significant latency. No biblio entries for each inscription or links to other treatments or information about it. Disappointing!
