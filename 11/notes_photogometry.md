Problem: how to create copies of physical inscriptions?
    - manual ways:
        - 'squeeze'
        - latex
        - charcoal
    - problems: not perfect, damages the inscription, not sharable, etc

Reflectance transformation imaging
    - taking a photo of something multiple times, with the light source moving
    - RTI domes - camera on top, dome loaded with LED lights
Metashape / photoscan
    - oppositte: light stays the same, camera moves around


Using Agishape
    - drag a bunch of photos into the folder in the program on lhs
    - workflow > align photos
    - delete extra points with the rectangle select tool
    - workflow > build mesh
    - workflow > build texture
    > uploaded to sketchfab
