    Based on your readings, expand shortly (less than 80 words) how 3D modeling has assisted the archaeological process.

3D Modeling allows archeological mapping: with greater accuracy and scale than previously possible, at a low cost, without as high a risk of damaging objects in the process of making models (like, e.g., a 'squeeze' on an inscription would). A 3d model model can represent precise details from artefacts with precision, and those models can be easily distributed and shared digitally.
