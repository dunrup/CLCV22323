# What is a historical gazetteer, and whatâ€™s its purpose?
A gazetteer is a geographical dictionary or index that gives geographical/physical features, social statistics, and geographical identifiers (like longitude/latitude) of its different entries. Modern gazetteers often include information like population and literacy rate alonside physical statistics like altitude. Gazetteers are often used in conjunction with maps to represent and analyze physical space.

Historical gazetteers give information about sites that no longer exist for historians (and historians' eccentric cousins, classiciscs). Unlike maps, arragned spatially on an abstract representation of physical space, gazetteers give information about sites and their various names and name changes in list/index form -- that is, semantically rather than geographically. Hence gazetteers are vital on the web, where links and searches are almost entirely semantic. Per Southall, Mostern, and Berman,

> The crucial point is that gazetteers [through named-based searching] form the essential link between the specialised geo-web and the wider web of words and hyperlinks.

Southall, Mostern, and Berman argue that a historical gazetteer ought to be less linked to geographic space, to the topographical features of an area, and more towards the "human geography" of administrative units, populated zones, and culturally significant areas. This will allow a type of flexibility, for gazetteers to be made with "less" information in the sense of spatial specificity, but then richer in other areas, like showing the dates of name changes of population centers. 

# How does Pleiades differ from its printed predecessor, Barrington Atlas?

First and foremost, the Barrington Atlas is an atlas -- a collection of maps. Maps display things spatially; gazatteers semantically. 

Secondarily, decades of development of digital tools stand between the two projects. Pleiades is a fully-digital project, designed for a digital space. The BA was a paper project later converted to CD-ROM / iPad app. (Similarly, Pleiades is crowd-sourced; BA developed by paid researchers via grant funding.) P can be (and is) constantly updated; BA more-or-less static. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, P treats "space" as a cognitive construct rather than a specifically physical zone, which allows mapping of places we know existed but don't know where vel sim.
