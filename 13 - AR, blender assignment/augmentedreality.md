Based on your readings, expand shortly (less than 80-100 words) how the integration of augmented reality in archaeology readings impacted our understanding of historical sites and museums. 

AR can allow greater accessibility to museums' collections by giving viewers the ability to interact with something in a quasi-tactile (digital) way (Kyriakou, Hermon).

"Immersive" viewing of data, by stannding inside 3d models of archaeological spaces, allows for an intuitive and new way of understanding space (Liang).

VR/AR can provide historically accurate reconstructions to give visitors a more impactful experience at heritage sites and museums (Younes et al).

As to the last point, I can speak from experience. The Baths of Caracalla in Rome have an AR set available that allows visitors to walk through the baths with glittering 'reconstructed' marble shining around them thru the AR spectacles. Students love this.
